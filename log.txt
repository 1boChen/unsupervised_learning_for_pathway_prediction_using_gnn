data preprocess:
1. download all KGML file using KEGG API
2. Parse KGML file
3. Get rid of indirect effect, missing interaction, undefined entities.
4. Divide training, val, test based on pathways 70%, 15%, 15%.
5. Clean up unseen entity's relations in val and test.
6. Constructing graph using networkX, multiDigraph.
7. Construct similarity matrix based on Katz similarity.
8. Clustering

Why not spectral clustering:
1. Optimal cluster number is always 2 (based on eigenmap and silhouette score.)
2. Spectral clustering needs dense matrix.
3. 


Data Preparation:

Convert your pathway data into a graph representation, where nodes represent molecules (genes, proteins, compounds) and edges represent interactions (relations, reactions).
Ensure that the graph is properly weighted, if necessary, based on the type or strength of interactions.
Similarity Matrix Construction:

Construct a similarity matrix representing the similarity between every pair of nodes in the graph. This could be based on shared interaction patterns, shared pathways, or other biological data.
The similarity matrix should capture the notion that molecules involved in the same pathways or with similar interaction partners are more similar.
Spectral Clustering:

Apply spectral clustering to the similarity matrix. This involves using eigenvalue decomposition to project the data into a lower-dimensional space where clustering is more straightforward.
Determine the number of clusters (k) using domain knowledge or techniques like the eigengap heuristic.

Analysis of Clusters:

Analyze the resulting clusters to identify groups of molecules that are more interconnected or share similar properties.
Investigate these clusters for potential new interactions or functional similarities.
Validation:

Validate the findings with existing biological knowledge. This could involve literature review, database searches, or experimental verification.
Consider cross-referencing the clusters with known pathways, interaction databases, or gene ontology terms to assess their biological relevance.
Iterative Refinement:

Adjust the clustering process based on validation results. This might involve tuning parameters, incorporating more data, or trying different clustering algorithms.

Consider other cluster techniques:
Consider Alternative Clustering Algorithms: If spectral clustering does not yield informative results, consider other clustering algorithms like hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, or HDBSCAN, which might be more suitable for your specific dataset.
